# HDB Resale ETL Pipeline — Documentation

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for HDB resale flat. The pipeline ingests raw CSV files, profiles and validates the data, cleans and transforms it, and outputs a final dataset ready for analysis.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Ingest (`ingest.py`)

Downloads all available HDB resale flat price dataset API and combines them into a single raw CSV file saved to `data/raw/`.

- Output: `data/raw/master_combined_raw.csv`

### 2. Profile (`profile.py`)

Generates a data quality profile of the raw dataset before any cleaning is applied. This includes null counts, duplicate counts, data types, and basic statistics per column.

- Input: `data/raw/master_combined_raw.csv`
- Output: printed report to console

### 3. Validate (`validate.py`)

Applies row-level validation rules to flag records that do not meet expected data quality standards. Flagged rows are separated from valid rows.

Validation rules include:

- `month` must match format `YYYY-MM`
- `town` must be a known HDB town
- `flat_type` must be one of the accepted flat types
- `storey_range` must match format `XX TO XX`
- `floor_area_sqm` must be between 20 and 400
- `resale_price` must be greater than 0
- `lease_commence_date` must be a 4-digit year between 1960 and the current year

- Input: `data/raw/master_combined_raw.csv`
- Output: valid rows → `data/cleaned/`, failed rows → `data/failed/`

### 4. Clean (`clean.py`)

Applies cleaning operations to the validated dataset, including trimming whitespace, standardising string casing, fixing date formats, and removing duplicates.

- Input: `data/cleaned/`
- Output: `data/cleaned/master_cleaned.csv`

### 5. Transform (`transform.py`)

Applies business logic transformations to enrich the cleaned dataset. New derived columns are added to support downstream analysis.

Transformations include:

- Extracting `year` and `quarter` from `month`
- Parsing `storey_range` into `storey_low` and `storey_high` integer columns
- Computing `storey_mid` as the midpoint of the storey range
- Computing `remaining_lease_years` from `lease_commence_date`
- Computing `price_per_sqm` from `resale_price` and `floor_area_sqm`

- Input: `data/cleaned/master_cleaned.csv`
- Output: `data/transformed/master_transformed.csv`

### 6. Output (`output.py`)

Writes the final transformed dataset to the output location and generates a summary report of the pipeline run, including row counts at each stage.

- Input: `data/transformed/master_transformed.csv`
- Output: final CSV and pipeline run summary

## Data Dictionary

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `month` | string | Transaction month in `YYYY-MM` format |
| `town` | string | HDB town where the flat is located |
| `flat_type` | string | Flat type (e.g. 3 ROOM, 4 ROOM, 5 ROOM) |
| `block` | string | Block number of the flat |
| `street_name` | string | Street name of the flat |
| `storey_range` | string | Storey range in `XX TO XX` format |
| `floor_area_sqm` | float | Floor area in square metres |
| `flat_model` | string | Flat model (e.g. Improved, New Generation) |
| `lease_commence_date` | integer | Year the lease commenced |
| `remaining_lease` | string | Remaining lease in years and months (where available) |
| `resale_price` | float | Resale transaction price in SGD |
| `year` | integer | Derived from `month` |
| `quarter` | string | Derived from `month` (e.g. Q1, Q2) |
| `storey_low` | integer | Lower bound of storey range |
| `storey_high` | integer | Upper bound of storey range |
| `storey_mid` | float | Midpoint of storey range |
| `remaining_lease_years` | float | Remaining lease in years (derived) |
| `price_per_sqm` | float | Resale price divided by floor area |

## Assumptions and Design Decisions

- Records that fail validation are not dropped but isolated to `data/failed/` for review. This allows the pipeline to be audited and rerun after investigation.
- Deduplication is based on a hash of key fields (`month`, `block`, `street_name`, `storey_range`, `flat_type`, `resale_price`) to avoid removing legitimate repeat transactions.
- The pipeline is designed to be idempotent — running it multiple times on the same input should produce the same output.
- All string fields are uppercased and trimmed for consistency.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies. Key libraries used:

- `pandas` — data manipulation
- `requests` — API calls to data.gov.sg
- `hashlib` — row-level deduplication hashing
- `pytest` — unit testing
